## Dagger 2 explanation
In this sample, I want to figure out dagger 2 usage, I will try to describe dagger things in easiest understanding way included image and snip code. In specific way, this project need to clarify:

- what is `module`
- what is `component`: what is `void inject`, how `expose object`
- what is `@scope`, `@qualifier`, `@name`, `@retention`

How about project strucutre (**TBD**)?
